Description:

	This program uses x,y, and z cordinates to show its orientation in 3d space. This data is
	collected from the Freescale MMA7260Q 3-Axis Accelerometer. This program uses an Arudino
	to read in the data using Analog In (A0,A1,A2) to read the data and display it on the 
	Serial Monitor.
